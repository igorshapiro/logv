the screen to be associated with.\n- **parent** - the desired parent.\n- **children** - an arrray of children.\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- inherits all from EventEmitter.\n- **type** - type of the node (e.g. `box`).\n- **options** - original options object.\n- **parent** - parent node.\n- **screen** - parent screen.\n- **children** - array of node's children.\n- **data, _, $** - an object for any miscellanous user data.\n- **index** - render index (document order index) of the last render call.\n\n##### Events:\n\n- inherits all from EventEmitter.\n- **adopt** - received when node is added to a parent.\n- **remove** - received when node is removed from it's current parent.\n- **reparent** - received when node gains a new parent.\n- **attach** - received when node is attached to the screen directly or\n  somewhere in its ancestry.\n- **detach** - received when node is detached from the screen directly or\n  somewhere in its ancestry.\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- inherits all from EventEmitter.\n- **prepend(node)** - prepend a node to this node's children.\n- **append(node)** - append a node to this node's children.\n- **remove(node)** - remove child node from node.\n- **insert(node, i)** - insert a node to this node's children at index `i`.\n- **insertBefore(node, refNode)** - insert a node to this node's children\n  before the reference node.\n- **insertAfter(node, refNode)** - insert a node from node after the reference\n  node.\n- **detach()** - remove node from its parent.\n- **emitDescendants(type, args..., [iterator])** - emit event for element, and\n  recursively emit same event for all descendants.\n- **get(name, [default])** - get user property with a potential default value.\n- **set(name, value)** - set user property to value.\n\n\n#### Screen (from Node)\n\nThe screen on which every other node renders.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- **program** - the blessed Program to be associated with.\n- **smartCSR** - attempt to perform CSR optimization on all possible elements\n  (not just full-width ones, elements with uniform cells to their sides).\n  this is known to cause flickering with elements that are not full-width,\n  however, it is more optimal for terminal rendering.\n- **fastCSR** - do CSR on any element within 20 cols of the screen edge on\n  either side. faster than `smartCSR`, but may cause flickering depending on\n  what is on each side of the element.\n- **useBCE** - attempt to perform `back_color_erase` optimizations for terminals\n  that support it. it will also work with terminals that don't support it, but\n  only on lines with the default background color. as it stands with the current\n  implementation, it's uncertain how much terminal performance this adds at the\n  cost of overhead within node.\n- **resizeTimeout** - amount of time (in ms) to redraw the screen after the\n  terminal is resized (default: 300).\n- **tabSize** - the width of tabs within an element's content.\n- **autoPadding** - automatically position child elements with border and\n  padding in mind.\n- **log** - create a log file. see `log` method.\n- **dump** - dump all output and input to desired file. can be used together\n  with `log` option if set as a boolean.\n- **debug** - debug mode. enables usage of the `debug` method.\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- inherits all from Node.\n- **program** - the blessed Program object.\n- **tput** - the blessed Tput object (only available if you passed `tput: true`\n  to the Program constructor.)\n- **focused** - top of the focus history stack.\n- **width** - width of the screen (same as `program.cols`).\n- **height** - height of the screen (same as `program.rows`).\n- **cols** - same as `screen.width`.\n- **rows** - same as `screen.height`.\n- **left**, **rleft** - left offset, always zero.\n- **right**, **rright** - right offset, always zero.\n- **top**, **rtop** - top offset, always zero.\n- **bottom**, **rbottom** - bottom offset, always zero.\n- **grabKeys** - whether the focused element grabs all keypresses.\n- **lockKeys** - prevent keypresses from being received by any element.\n- **hover** - the currently hovered element. only set if mouse events are bound.\n\n##### Events:\n\n- inherits all from Node.\n- **resize** - received on screen resize.\n- **mouse** - received on mouse events.\n- **keypress** - received on key events.\n- **element [name]** - global events received for all elements.\n- **key [name]** - received on key event for [name].\n- **focus, blur** - received when the terminal window focuses/blurs. requires a\n  terminal supporting the focus protocol and focus needs to be passed to\n  program.enableMouse().\n- **prerender** - received before render.\n- **render** - received on render.\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- inherits all from Node.\n- **log(msg, ...)** - write string to the log file if one was created.\n- **debug(msg, ...)** - same as the log method, but only gets called if the\n  `debug` option was set.\n- **alloc()** - allocate a new pending screen buffer and a new output screen\n  buffer.\n- **draw(start, end)** - draw the screen based on the contents of the screen\n  buffer.\n- **render()** - render all child elements, writing all data to the screen\n  buffer and drawing the screen.\n- **clearRegion(x1, x2, y1, y2)** - clear any region on the screen.\n- **fillRegion(attr, ch, x1, x2, y1, y2)** - fill any region with a character\n  of a certain attribute.\n- **focusOffset(offset)** - focus element by offset of focusable elements.\n- **focusPrevious()** - focus previous element in the index.\n- **focusNext()** - focus next element in the index.\n- **focusPush(element)** - push element on the focus stack (equivalent to\n  `screen.focused = el`).\n- **focusPop()** -

RadioButtons within this element will be\nmutually exclusive with each other.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- inherits all from Box.\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- inherits all from Box.\n\n##### Events:\n\n- inherits all from Box.\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- inherits all from Box.\n\n\n#### RadioButton (from Checkbox)\n\nA radio button which can be used in a form element.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- inherits all from Checkbox.\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- inherits all from Checkbox.\n\n##### Events:\n\n- inherits all from Checkbox.\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- inherits all from Checkbox.\n\n\n### Positioning\n\nOffsets may be a number, a percentage (e.g. `50%`), or a keyword (e.g.\n`center`).\n\nDimensions may be a number, or a percentage (e.g. `50%`).\n\nPositions are treated almost *exactly* the same as they are in CSS/CSSOM when\nan element has the `position: absolute` CSS property.\n\nWhen an element is created, it can be given coordinates in its constructor:\n\n``` js\nvar box = blessed.box({\n  left: 'center',\n  top: 'center',\n  bg: 'yellow',\n  width: '50%',\n  height: '50%'\n});\n```\n\nThis tells blessed to create a box, perfectly centered **relative to its\nparent**, 50% as wide and 50% as tall as its parent.\n\nTo access the calculated offsets, relative to the parent:\n\n``` js\nconsole.log(box.rleft);\nconsole.log(box.rtop);\n```\n\nTo access the calculated offsets, absolute (relative to the screen):\n\n``` js\nconsole.log(box.left);\nconsole.log(box.top);\n```\n\n#### Overlapping offsets and dimensions greater than parents'\n\nThis still needs to be tested a bit, but it should work.\n\n\n### Content\n\nEvery element can have text content via `setContent`. If `tags: true` was\npassed to the element's constructor, the content can contain tags. For example:\n\n```\nbox.setContent('hello {red-fg}{green-bg}{bold}world{/bold}{/green-bg}{/red-fg}');\n```\n\nTo make this more concise `{/}` cancels all character attributes.\n\n```\nbox.setContent('hello {red-fg}{green-bg}{bold}world{/}');\n```\n\nNewlines and alignment are also possible in content.\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('hello\\n'\n  + '{right}world{/right}\\n'\n  + '{center}foo{/center}');\n```\n\nThis will produce a box that looks like:\n\n```\n| hello                 |\n|                 world |\n|          foo          |\n```\n\nContent can also handle SGR escape codes. This means if you got output from a\nprogram, say `git log` for example, you can feed it directly to an element's\ncontent and the colors will be parsed appropriately.\n\nThis means that while `{red-fg}foo{/red-fg}` produces `^[[31mfoo^[[39m`, you\ncould just feed `^[[31mfoo^[[39m` directly to the content.\n\n\n### Event Bubbling\n\nEvents can bubble in blessed. For example:\n\nReceiving all click events for `box`:\n\n``` js\nbox.on('click', function(mouse) {\n  box.setContent('You clicked ' + mouse.x + ', ' + mouse.y + '.');\n  screen.render();\n});\n```\n\nReceiving all click events for `box`, as well as all of its children:\n\n``` js\nbox.on('element click', function(el, mouse) {\n  box.setContent('You clicked '\n    + el.type + ' at ' + mouse.x + ', ' + mouse.y + '.');\n  screen.render();\n  if (el === box) {\n    return false; // Cancel propagation.\n  }\n});\n```\n\n`el` gets passed in as the first argument. It refers to the target element the\nevent occurred on. Returning `false` will cancel propagation up the tree.\n\n\n### Rendering\n\nTo actually render the screen buffer, you must call `render`.\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('Hello world.');\nscreen.render();\n```\n\nElements are rendered with the lower elements in the children array being\npainted first. In terms of the painter's algorithm, the lowest indicies in the\narray are the furthest away, just like in the DOM.\n\n\n### Testing\n\n- For an interactive test, see `test/widget.js`.\n- For a less interactive position testing, see `test/widget-pos.js`.\n\n\n## Lower-Level Usage\n\nThis will actually parse the xterm terminfo and compile every\nstring capability to a javascript function:\n\n``` js\nvar blessed = require('blessed')\n  , tput = blessed.tput('xterm-256color');\n\nconsole.log(tput.setaf(4) + 'hello' + tput.sgr0());\n```\n\nTo play around with it on the command line, it works just like tput:\n\n``` bash\n$ tput.js setaf 2\n$ tput.js sgr0\n$ echo \"$(tput.js setaf 2)hello world$(tput.js sgr0)\"\n```\n\nThe main functionality is exposed in the main `blessed` module:\n\n``` js\nvar blessed = require('blessed')\n  , program = blessed.program();\n\nprogram.key('q', function(ch, key) {\n  program.clear();\n  program.disableMouse();\n  program.showCursor();\n  program.normalBuffer();\n  process.exit(0);\n});\n\nprogram.on('mouse', function(data) {\n  if (data.action === 'mousemove') {\n    program.move(data.x, data.y);\n    program.bg('red');\n    program.write('x');\n    program.bg('!red');\n  }\n});\n\nprogram.alternateBuffer();\nprogram.enableMouse();\nprogram.hideCursor();\nprogram.clear();\n\nprogram.move(1, 1);\nprogram.bg('black');\nprogram.write('Hello world', 'blue fg');\nprogram.setx((program.cols / 2 | 0) - 4);\nprogram.down(5);\nprogram.write('Hi again!');\nprogram.bg('!black');\nprogram.feed();\n```\n\n## Contribution and License Agreement\n\nIf you contribute code to this project, you are implicitly allowing your code\nto be distributed under the MIT license.
